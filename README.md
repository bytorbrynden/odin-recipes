# The Odin Project - Foundations Course
## Project: Recipes
In an attempt to jump back into the world of web development, I decided to work my way through "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)". I made a personal commitment to follow along with everything included in the course, including all of the simplest projects. The first project, part of the Foundations Course, is to build a couple simple HTML pages to display recipes.

This is the repository where you will find what I submitted for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns.
